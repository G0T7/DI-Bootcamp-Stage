            <h3>IRON MAN</h3>
            <p><br>“Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the company Stark Industries. Beginning his career as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone, and his heart is severely injured by shrapnel. 
                To sustain his heart and escape his captors, he builds a technologically advanced armor. After escaping, he continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War.
                 Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.”</p>
