//let c;
//let a = 34;
//let b = 21;

//console.log(a+b) //first expression
// Prediction: (a + b) is 55
// Actual: 55

//a = 2;

//console.log(a+b) //second expression
// Prediction: after 'a' is reassigned sum is going to be 23
// Actual: 23

//What is the value of c?
//undefined

//Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
//console.log(3 + 4 + '5'); 75 
//3 + 4: This adds up to 7.
//7 + '5': Here, since one of the operands is a string ('5'), 
//JavaScript will perform concatenation rather than addition. 
//So, 7 will be converted to the string '7' and concatenated with '5'.
//hence outcome is '75'
