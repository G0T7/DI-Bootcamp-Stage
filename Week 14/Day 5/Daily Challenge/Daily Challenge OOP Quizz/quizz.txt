Part 1: Quiz
What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances).
 It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
  In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword.

What is an instance?
An instance is a specific object created from a class. 
Each instance has its own unique set of data, although it shares the structure and behavior defined by the class.

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is an OOP principle that bundles the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, a class.
 It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.
  This is typically achieved through the use of access modifiers like private and public.

What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant features to the user. 
It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by providing a simplified model of the system.

What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (child class) is derived from an existing class (parent class). 
The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, which allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

What is multiple inheritance?
Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.
 This allows a class to combine the behavior and properties of multiple classes.

What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. 
It allows methods to be used interchangeably with different objects, meaning the same method can have different implementations in different classes.

What is method resolution order (MRO)?
MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes. It is especially relevant in the context of multiple inheritance.
 Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which ensures a consistent and predictable order of method resolution.
